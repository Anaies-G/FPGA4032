# FPGA4032 - FPGA Design Course Projects  

This repository contains my coursework for the **FPGA Design** course, instructed by **Dr. Hossein Hosseini-Nejad**. The projects involve **VHDL programming** for FPGA implementation, including **simulation, synthesis, and verification** using **Xilinx Vivado 2022.2**.  

## üìÅ Repository Structure  
Each exercise (`EXS`) includes:  
- **Assignment PDF** (`EXS#.pdf`) ‚Äì Problem statement and requirements.  
- **VHDL Source Code** (`.vhd`) ‚Äì Implemented solutions.  
- **Vivado Project Files** ‚Äì Synthesis and simulation setup.  
- **Report** ‚Äì Brief explanation of the design, simulation results, and synthesis outcomes.  

## üöÄ Projects Overview  

### **EXS1: Stopwatch & Wave Generator**  
- Designed a **stopwatch** with start/stop/reset functionality.  
- Implemented a **configurable wave generator** with adjustable duty cycle.  

### **EXS2: Convolution Calculator**  
- Developed a **structural VHDL design** for convolution computation.  

### **EXS3: Memory Designs**  
- Implemented **dual-port RAM** and **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) memory**.  
- Referenced course materials and previous semester archives for optimization.  

### **EXS4: State Machine & SPI Communication**  
- Designed a **finite state machine (FSM)**.  
- Implemented the **SPI communication protocol** for data transfer.  

### **EXS5: Matrix Multiplication (Clock-Based)**  
- Developed a **clock-controlled matrix multiplier** in VHDL.  

## üõ† Tools Used  
- **Xilinx Vivado 2022.2** (Simulation & Synthesis)  
- **VHDL** (Hardware Description Language)  

## üìù Notes  
- Some designs (e.g., EXS3) were inspired by course pamphlets and prior semester implementations.  
- Reports include synthesis results (timing, resource utilization) and simulation waveforms.
